Sure, here's how you can create a `requirements.txt` file and a basic documentation file for your GitHub repository:



2. **Creating Documentation**:

   You can create a README.md file to serve as documentation for your GitHub repository. Here's an example of what you can include in your README:

   ```markdown
   # Bird View GUI

   Bird View GUI is a Python application for visualizing walking paths in a specified location using OSMnx and Matplotlib.

   ## Installation

   1. Clone the repository:

      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bird-view-gui.git
      ```

   2. Install dependencies:

      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

   ## Usage

   1. Navigate to the project directory:

      ```bash
      cd bird-view-gui
      ```

   2. Run the application:

      ```bash
      python bird-view-gui.py
      ```

      To run the executable from anywhere in the terminal, you need to add the directory containing the executable to your system's PATH environment variable. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Locate the Executable**: Find the directory containing the executable file (`bird-view-gui`) that was generated by PyInstaller. Let's assume the path is `/path/to/your/project/bin`.

2. **Update PATH Environment Variable**:

   - Open your shell configuration file. This could be `~/.bashrc` if you're using Bash, `~/.zshrc` for Zsh, or `~/.bash_profile` for macOS users.
   
   - Add the following line at the end of the file:

     ```bash
     export PATH="/path/to/your/project/bin:$PATH"
     ```

     Replace `/path/to/your/project/bin` with the actual path to the directory containing the executable.

3. **Apply Changes**:

   - Save the file and exit the text editor.
   
   - To apply the changes to the current terminal session, run:

     ```bash
     source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc, or ~/.bash_profile
     ```

Now, you should be able to run the `bird-view-gui` executable from anywhere in the terminal without specifying the full path.

To verify that it's working, open a new terminal session and type:

```bash
bird-view-gui
```

If everything is set up correctly, it should execute the `bird-view-gui` application.
